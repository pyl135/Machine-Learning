Supervised Learning
-  Linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, SVMS

Unsupervised Learning
-  K-means, PCA, Anormaly detection

Special applications/special topics
-  Recommender systems, large scale machine learning

Advice on building a machine learning system
-  Bias/variance, regularization; deciding what to work on next:
   evaluation of learning algorithms, learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis
